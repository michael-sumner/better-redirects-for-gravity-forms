Avoids 404 errors in your form confirmation redirects. Specify your confirmation redirect URL, so that form redirects will never 404 again.

== Description ==

**Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** future-proofs your Gravity Forms confirmation redirect URL, so that if your redirect URL ever changes, you will still be able to redirect your users without 404 errors.

#### Zero-maintenance form confirmation redirect URLs

#### Simple setup

* Set your form to use a confirmation redirect within Gravity Forms, and specify the URL within the **Better Redirect** section whilst editing your form confirmation.

#### Never have to update a confirmation URL again

* When you update the URL permalink / slug, and it happens to be within a Gravity Form confirmation redirect URL, **Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** will automatically update all form confirmations containing the updated URL.

### Avoid 404 errors from your form internal redirect URLs for good 

* Because **Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** automatically updates the Gravity Forms form confirmation URLs for you, you will never have forms with broken confirmation URLs. No matter how many forms you have.

#### Good for Thank You pages

* **Thank You** pages are a common practice for confirmation redirect URLs upon successful form submission. You can rest assured that changing **Thank You** page URLs will be safe for your Gravity Forms.

#### Plugin support is readily available

* You can contact the plugin developer through the **Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** [Support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-redirects-for-gravity-forms/) for questions and issues you might have.

#### How is this plugin useful?

**Are you this guy:**

"I've changed the URL of a confirmation page... Now I have to go through the Gravity forms settings... and click around 5-10 times... for each form...".

**If you are... then you should be this guy instead:**

"I've installed **Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** that **automatically updates the confirmation page URL for me, across all Gravity forms that have that URL**. Life is good..."

#### Setup

1. Once this plugin is installed and activated, you can visit any of your **Gravity forms**, and within the **Settings** › **Confirmations**, select any confirmation (or create a new one).
2. Set your **Confirmation Type** as **Redirect**. You can leave the Redirect URL blank, we will change it in a minute.
3. Scroll to the bottom, you should find a section **Better Redirect**.
4. Now, click the button **Select Link**, and choose a link.
5. Once you have added the link, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the button **Save Confirmation** to save this confirmation.
6. You have now saved the confirmation redirect so that when the specified URL updates in the future, **the URL will automatically update itself across all confirmations containing that URL**. This is awesome!

#### Support

* You can contact the plugin developer through the **Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** [Support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-redirects-for-gravity-forms/) for questions and issues you might have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

**Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** uses a combination of WordPress action hooks and Gravity Forms filters to find out if your forms have a **confirmation redirect URL** specified. So if you have a page / post / custom post type / taxonomy / front page / shop page / or any other link that you have updated within WordPress, your Gravity forms will still redirect to the proper URL.

= Does this work for external URLs? =

No, this does not work for external URLs. **Better Redirects for Gravity Forms** will have no trace that the external URL has been modified. If you require this feature, please submit it as a **customisation request** within the [Support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-redirects-for-gravity-forms/).

= Can I see your code? =
